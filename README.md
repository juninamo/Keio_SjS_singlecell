## Dissection of salivary glands by autoantibody profile in Sjögren's syndrome reveals common and distinct T-cell subsets and fibroblast-mediated inflammation

Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease that causes salivary gland dysfunction due to immune-mediated destruction. While autoantibodies such as anti-SSA and anti-centromere (CENT) are associated with distinct clinical manifestations, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this study, we apply multi-modal single-cell technologies —single-cell RNA sequencing, T- and B-cell receptor sequencing— and spatial transcriptomics to salivary gland lesions, aiming to uncover common and unique cellular and transcriptional signatures linked to different autoantibody profiles. Our analysis demonstrates that GZMB+GNLY+ CD8+ T cells are the main expanded subset across different autoantibody statuses, highlighting their central role in SS pathogenesis, while the enrichment of activated CD4+ T cell subsets, including Tph and Treg cells, is more prominent in anti-CENT-positive patients. Cytokine signaling also differs by autoantibody profile, with an activated interferon signature in anti-SSA-positive patients, whereas TGFβ signaling is enhanced in anti-CENT-positive patients. Furthermore, spatial profiling reveals THY1+ fibroblasts, expressing complement genes and chemokines, as key hubs orchestrating inflammation within the salivary glands. These findings deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of SS, and may inform the development of targeted and personalized therapeutic strategies.
