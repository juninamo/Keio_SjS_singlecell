## Dissection of Sjögren's syndrome salivary glands with distinct autoantibody profiles reveals activated T cell subsets and fibroblast-mediated inflammation 

Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease affecting the salivary glands, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying different autoantibody profiles remain elusive. We applied multi-modal single-cell technologies on salivary glands from SS patients with anti-SSA, anti-centromere (CENT), or both antibodies, and seronegative SS. Our integrated analysis revealed distinct immune cell subsets, including activated helper and cytotoxic T cells, and transcriptional profiles associated with each autoantibody group. Spatial profiling identified immune cell-enriched clusters with differential activation of signaling pathways, suggesting shared mechanisms between anti-CENT SS and systemic sclerosis. Further, we discovered THY1+ fibroblasts as key orchestrators of inflammation, engaging in crosstalk with immune cells through complement and chemokine signaling. Our findings highlight the heterogeneity of SS, providing insights into the cellular and molecular basis of the disease.
